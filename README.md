Trend Micro Malware Detection Competition

Both traditional methods and machine learning require the scanning and analysis of the original files of the malicious programs. When the number of files and the size of the files are large, it requires high computing resources. Therefore, we must make good use of other information to predict the suspicious degree of a file to reduce the actual computing resources needed to scan the file. The competition aims to determine whether a program is a malicious program by using a computer's computer to discover suspicious file records without using a original file (file agnostic).
